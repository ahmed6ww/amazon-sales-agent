        "why": "High-volume keywords ('beauty blender' 71K, 'makeup sponges' 16K) were going to bullets instead of title. Root cause: title allocation was using get_top_keywords_by_relevancy() which sorts by volume BUT had limit of only 3 keywords, and AI might ignore allocated keywords. Solution: 1) Increase title limit from 3 to 8, 2) Add get_top_keywords_by_volume_strict() that ONLY sorts by volume (ignores relevancy/intent), 3) Use strict volume sorting specifically for title allocation, 4) Enhanced post-generation validation to check top 5 keywords by volume and reject if top 2 are missing.",
