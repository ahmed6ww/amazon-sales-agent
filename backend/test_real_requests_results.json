              "The AirPods Pro 2 sound amazing\u2014clear vocals, deep bass, and a nice balance overall. The active noise cancellation works surprisingly well, blocking out most background noise when I\u2019m on the bus or at the gym. Transparency mode feels very natural too. They connect instantly with my iPhone, and the fit is comfortable enough to wear for hours without slipping. Battery life is solid, and the charging case is compact and easy to carry. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it for the quality and convenience.",
              "I\u2019ve tried several hearing aid substitutes over the years, my past favorite being the now unavailable Bose Hearphones and costing $500. Rather than just a sound amplifier, these had several functions allowing you to filter and focus sounds in various ways and for various situations. They were pretty good.",
              "But now Apple has added some great features to their AirPods 2\u2014features that function like far more expensive hearing aids and at less than half the price of the Bose product. I\u2019ve owned these for a month or so and am now just getting the hang of how to use them. If there is a downside to these earbuds it is the rather deep and confusing tech included in them (or, at least confusing for a grandfatherly type like me). Once they are Bluetooth connected to your iPhone (They connect very easily with the button on the front of the EarPod\u2019s charging case.) they should automatically connect every time you put them in your ears. You will then be able to access all the functions by tapping the \u201csettings\u201d app on your phone. You will find a heading near the top of the list just below the box with your name and iCloud options. Tapping on this will allow you to drill down through several pages of options. There are a lot of options there and it can be confusing, but experimenting with the various functions will help you figure out their purpose.",
              "The key here is to drill down to find the hearing test. This will quickly test for hearing loss by leading you through a series of tones of varying in pitch and volume. The end result will be an audiogram that can be used to program your EarPods as hearing aids. As stated before, it took me several weeks to find and activate this feature, but when I did a whole new experience dawned. Just be patient and search around for this function. It works very well.",
              "Of course, these things also serve as EarPods to listen to music or podcasts. (May I recommend \u201cPat Gray Unleashed!\u201d if your bent is conservative commentary and just plain fooling around). The quality of sound is phenomenal and the buds are more comfortable than most to keep in your ears for an extended time. To control the volume for this function you can TRY to use the external control buttons located on those silly looking stems that hang out of your ears (good luck) OR just open the \u201cControl Center\u201d page (slide one finger upward on your iPhone screen to access this page) where you\u2019ll find the volume slider. If your EarPods are connected and in your ears you\u2019ll see the slider is marked as controlling the AirPods."

It is clear, vibrant, and powerful enough to fill the room. It\u2019s also perfect for our daily routines; we use Alexa for reminders, chore announcements, and even quick drop-ins between rooms, which makes family communication so much easier. For a very busy household, this little speaker feels like a real helper. The routines and voice control features make it simple for the kids to interact with, and it helps keep things running smoothly without me needing to call out reminders constantly.",
              "The only frustration we\u2019ve had is with Apple Music connectivity. Alexa usually needs to be reminded which service to use, and we occasionally have to repeat commands. Still, for the price, convenience, and overall performance, it\u2019s an excellent addition to our Echo smart system.",

              "Absolutely love this watch! It\u2019s my first smart watch, so I decided to start with the SE and if I wanted to upgrade to the Series 9/10 I could later. But this little watch does everything I need it to. I don\u2019t work out a lot, but I enjoy using it when I dance and go on walks. I like that you can text or answer calls quickly when you\u2019re away from your phone. I have a very hands-on job, but the screen looks good, some scratches if you look reallly hard, but no large cracks. I also really like the starlight color, it\u2019s a nice warmer silver that matches more of my outfits/jewelry. Vernal, very happy with it.",

              "I honestly can\u2019t say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won\u2019t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.",
              "My oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn\u2019t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.",
              "The phone was sent via UPS, which I didn\u2019t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn\u2019t deliver it until 10pm! But that\u2019s an issue with UPS, not the seller.",
              "When we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn\u2019t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn\u2019t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.",
              "The seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they\u2019d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn\u2019t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they\u2019d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn\u2019t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I\u2019d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I\u2019d be sending it back with it on."
