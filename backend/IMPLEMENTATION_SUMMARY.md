# Implementation Summary - Title & Bullet Keyword Handling ✅

**Date**: Now
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 🎯 **User Requirement**

> "Don't count the keywords that were in title and bullets as one. If there is 'freeze dried strawberries' in title and bullet, don't count this as duplicate because the count of title and bullet points are separate. But if the keyword is repeated in the bullets, then it is duplicate."

---

## ✅ **Implementation**

### **What Was Done:**

1. ✅ **Removed title-to-bullet keyword filtering**

   - Removed Task 4 post-processing from `amazon_compliance_agent.py`
   - Removed "NO TITLE REDUNDANCY" rule from AI prompt

2. ✅ **Kept bullet-to-bullet deduplication**

   - `seo_keyword_filter.py` still removes duplicates between bullets
   - Updated comments to clarify the behavior

3. ✅ **Created documentation**
   - `HOTFIX_SEPARATE_TITLE_BULLET_COUNTS.md` explains the new behavior
   - Deleted incorrect `HOTFIX_REQUIREMENT_4_RESTORED.md`

---

## 📊 **Deduplication Rules**

### ✅ **Allowed (Separate Counts):**

- Title + Bullet 1 share keyword ✅
- Title + Bullet 2 share keyword ✅
- Title + All bullets share keyword ✅

### ❌ **Not Allowed (Duplicates):**

- Bullet 1 + Bullet 2 share keyword ❌
- Bullet 2 + Bullet 3 share keyword ❌
- Any two bullets share keyword ❌

## 🚀 **Testing**

**Expected Results:**

```json
Title: {
  "keywords_included": ["freeze dried strawberries", "organic"],
  "count": 2
}

Bullet 1: {
  "keywords_included": ["freeze dried strawberries", "healthy snack"],
  "count": 2  ← "freeze dried strawberries" allowed (separate from title)
}

Bullet 2: {
  "keywords_included": ["organic", "natural fruit"],
  "count": 2  ← "organic" allowed (separate from title)
}

Bullet 3: {
  "keywords_included": ["kids lunch"],
  "count": 1  ← Can't have "organic" (already in Bullet 2)
}
```

**Log Output:**

```
✅ [SEO VALIDATION] Title: 2/2, Bullets: 5/7, Bullet-to-bullet duplicates removed: 2
```
