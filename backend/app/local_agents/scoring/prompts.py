INTENT_SCORING_PROMPT = """
Calculate intent scores (0-3) for keywords based on MVP requirements:

INTENT SCORING CRITERIA:

SCORE 0 (Irrelevant Intent):
- Keywords with no commercial relevance to the product
- Branded competitors (unless analyzing brand strategy)
- Completely unrelated terms or categories
- Spanish/foreign language terms (unless targeting those markets)
- Examples: "license plate" for baby products, competitor brand names

SCORE 1 (One Relevant Intent):
- Basic product relevance with single purchase intent
- Generic category terms with low specificity
- Keywords with minimal commercial signals
- Examples: "baby products", "infant items", very broad terms

SCORE 2 (Two Relevant Intents):
- Good commercial relevance with multiple purchase signals
- Specific product features or use cases
- Keywords showing clear buyer intent and product fit
- Examples: "waterproof changing pad", "portable baby mat"

SCORE 3 (Three Relevant Intents):
- Premium keywords with strongest commercial intent
- High buyer intent with specific product match
- Keywords indicating ready-to-purchase behavior
- Multiple commercial signals (urgency, specificity, need)
- Examples: "best changing pad for newborn", "buy wipeable changing mat"

ANALYSIS FACTORS:
- Keyword specificity and product relevance
- Commercial intent signals (buy, best, review, compare)
- Search volume and competition balance
- Category fit and business value
- User intent clarity and purchase likelihood

Keywords to score: {keywords_data}

For each keyword, provide:
1. Intent score (0-3) with detailed reasoning
2. Commercial intent analysis
3. Business value assessment
4. Recommendations for usage priority
"""

COMPETITION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
Analyze competition metrics for keyword prioritization:

COMPETITION METRICS TO EVALUATE:

1. CPR ANALYSIS (Cerebro Product Rank):
   - Lower CPR = easier to rank, higher opportunity
   - CPR > 50: High difficulty, established competition
   - CPR 20-50: Medium difficulty, competitive but achievable
   - CPR < 20: Low difficulty, good opportunity

2. TITLE DENSITY EVALUATION:
   - 0% density: Either irrelevant OR opportunity (per MVP rules)
   - Low density (1-20%): Potential opportunity if relevant
   - Medium density (21-50%): Competitive but achievable
   - High density (>50%): Saturated, difficult to differentiate

3. SEARCH VOLUME ASSESSMENT:
   - High volume + low competition = Premium opportunity
   - High volume + high competition = Difficult but valuable
   - Low volume + low competition = Easy wins, limited impact
   - Low volume + high competition = Avoid unless strategic

4. RELEVANCY INTEGRATION:
   - High relevancy (>60%) = Proven market demand
   - Medium relevancy (30-60%) = Moderate opportunity
   - Low relevancy (<30%) = Risky or niche opportunity

OPPORTUNITY SCORING (0-100):
- Combine search volume potential with ranking difficulty
- Factor in current market gaps and competitor weaknesses
- Consider business value and strategic importance
- Account for seasonal trends and market dynamics

Competition data to analyze: {competition_data}

For each keyword, provide:
1. Competition difficulty rating (Low/Medium/High)
2. Opportunity score (0-100) with justification
3. Ranking feasibility assessment
4. Strategic recommendations
5. Risk factors and considerations
"""

PRIORITIZATION_PROMPT = """
Create final keyword prioritization based on combined scoring:

PRIORITY LEVELS (MVP Requirements):

CRITICAL PRIORITY:
- Intent score: 3 (three relevant intents)
- High search volume (>1000/month)
- Medium-low competition difficulty
- Strong business value and ROI potential
- Must-have keywords for competitive advantage

HIGH PRIORITY:
- Intent score: 2-3 (two to three relevant intents)
- Good search volume (500-1000/month)
- Achievable competition level
- Clear business value and market opportunity
- Important for market positioning

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- Intent score: 1-2 (one to two relevant intents)
- Moderate search volume (200-500/month)
- Mixed competition signals
- Decent business value, supporting keywords
- Good for content expansion and coverage

LOW PRIORITY:
- Intent score: 1 (one relevant intent)
- Lower search volume (100-200/month)
- Low competition, easy wins
- Limited business impact but cost-effective
- Nice-to-have keywords for comprehensive coverage

FILTERED:
- Intent score: 0 (irrelevant intent)
- Very low volume (<100/month) with high competition
- Poor business fit or strategic misalignment
- Below minimum thresholds for inclusion

PRIORITY CALCULATION FORMULA:
Priority Score = (Intent Score × 30) + (Relevancy × 25) + (Volume Score × 25) + (Opportunity × 20)

Where:
- Intent Score: 0-3 normalized to 0-100
- Relevancy: 0-100 percentage from keyword agent
- Volume Score: Search volume normalized to 0-100 scale
- Opportunity: Competition opportunity score 0-100
