# Task 1: Keyword Categorization Logic - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Problem Statement

The AI was **miscategorizing keywords** in 3 main areas:

### Issue 1: Design-Specific vs Irrelevant Confusion

- **Problem**: Keywords for different product forms marked as "Design-Specific"
- **Example**: Product is "strawberry slices" ‚Üí "strawberry powder" marked as Design-Specific ‚ùå
- **Should be**: "powder" = IRRELEVANT (different product form)

### Issue 2: Weak Irrelevant Detection

- **Problem**: Keywords with no contextual connection weren't caught
- **Example**: "strawberry life" for food products passed through ‚ùå
- **Should be**: IRRELEVANT (nonsensical phrase)

### Issue 3: Missing Brand Detection

- **Problem**: Brand patterns being missed
- **Example**: "so natural freeze dried fruit" not caught as Branded ‚ùå
- **Should be**: BRANDED ("so natural" is a brand name)

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Prompt Instructions (`prompts.py`)

**Location**: `backend/app/local_agents/keyword/prompts.py`

**Changes**:

- ‚úÖ Added **STEP 1**: Extract product context BEFORE categorization

  - Extract BASE PRODUCT FORM (slices, powder, whole, liquid, etc.)
  - Identify BRAND from metadata
  - Understand product category

- ‚úÖ Added **STEP 2**: Strict categorization algorithm with test order:

  1. **Test 1**: Brand Detection (check first)
  2. **Test 2**: Language Check (Spanish/non-English)
  3. **Test 3**: Product Form Analysis (CRITICAL - different forms = IRRELEVANT)
  4. **Test 4**: Contextual Connection (nonsensical = IRRELEVANT)
  5. **Test 5**: Design-Specific or Relevant (attributes vs core)
  6. **Test 6**: Outlier Check (broad/generic terms)

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Brand Detection Patterns**:

  - Possessive forms: "anthony's", "bob's", "joe's"
  - Company names: "Nutristore", "Fresh Bellies", "Crispy Green"
  - Brand + product: "nesquik strawberry", "so natural freeze dried"
  - Multi-word brands: "Trader Joe", "Whole Foods", "365 Everyday"

- ‚úÖ **Critical Product Form Test**:

  ```
  Extract form from title ‚Üí Extract form from keyword ‚Üí Compare:
  - SAME form ‚Üí Could be Design-Specific or Relevant
  - DIFFERENT form ‚Üí MUST be Irrelevant
  ```

- ‚úÖ Added **concrete examples** for each category

### 2. Product Context Extraction (`runner.py`)

**Location**: `backend/app/local_agents/keyword/runner.py`

**Changes**:

- ‚úÖ **Extract Product Title** (with fallback to elements)
- ‚úÖ **Extract Brand** from productOverview_feature_div
- ‚úÖ **Extract Base Product Form** using pattern matching:

  - Supported forms: slices, powder, whole, liquid, capsules, tablets, oil, chunks, pieces, flakes, granules, crystals, drops, gummies, bars, bites

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Logging**:

  ```
  üîç [PRODUCT CONTEXT EXTRACTION]
     üì¶ Product Title: [title]
     üè∑Ô∏è  Brand: [brand]
     üìê Base Product Form: [form]
  ```

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Prompt** with explicit product context:
  - Title, Brand, Base Form passed explicitly
  - Critical instructions referencing the base form
  - Clear rules about form matching

---

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before Fix:

```
Product: "Freeze Dried Strawberry Slices"
Keywords:
- "freeze dried strawberry powder" ‚Üí Design-Specific ‚ùå
- "strawberry life" ‚Üí Relevant ‚ùå
- "so natural freeze dried fruit" ‚Üí Relevant ‚ùå
```

### After Fix:

```
Product: "Freeze Dried Strawberry Slices"
Brand: "Nature's Best"
Base Form: "slices"

Keywords:
- "freeze dried strawberry powder" ‚Üí Irrelevant ‚úÖ
  Reason: "Powder is different form than base product (slices) - Test 3"

- "strawberry life" ‚Üí Irrelevant ‚úÖ
  Reason: "No contextual connection to freeze dried product - Test 4"

- "so natural freeze dried fruit" ‚Üí Branded ‚úÖ
  Reason: "Contains brand name 'so natural' - Test 1"
```

---

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fix works:

1. ‚úÖ **Different product forms**:

   - Test slices/powder/whole are correctly distinguished
   - "powder" for "slices" product ‚Üí IRRELEVANT

2. ‚úÖ **Brand detection**:

   - Test possessive forms ("anthony's")
   - Test multi-word brands ("so natural", "trader joe's")
   - Test brand + product ("nesquik strawberry")

3. ‚úÖ **Irrelevant phrases**:

   - Test nonsensical combinations ("strawberry life")
   - Test instructional terms ("how to make")
   - Test recipes ("strawberry recipe")

4. ‚úÖ **Design-Specific accuracy**:

   - Verify only attributes marked (organic, bulk, large)
   - Verify NOT forms (powder, whole, liquid)

5. ‚úÖ **Log output verification**:
   - Check extraction logs show correct title/brand/form
   - Verify product context appears in logs
